# About this repo
This repo is used as a working repo for improvements on the NZK alexa skill.
The production version of the alexa skill, and the production git repo configuration can be found in the night-zookeeper-kids-stories.zip file. This is because alexa skill uses GitCommit (their own "github" solution in aws) to deploy stuff to alexa skills in production. To deploy things to the production version of the alexa skill, unzip the file in ANOTHER folder and just push the changes to the master branch. The .zip file contains the .git folder with the gitcommit configuration. You will find more details about how to deploy, test and check the alexa skills in the console in the README.md file inside the .zip file.

Alexa skill deployment is a bit painful so good luck.
